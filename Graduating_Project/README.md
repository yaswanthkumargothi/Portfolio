[preprocess.py](preprocess.py): preprocessing script to convert classified data into required cross sectional format for difference in difference modelling 

[yelpdata_explore.ipynb](yelpdata_explore.ipynb): Yelp data variable analysis

[export.pkl](export.pkl): load this pickle file using load_learner method from Fastai and get prediction classifications for data 

[diffndiff.R](diffndiff.R): R file to plot assumptions and build difference in difference models

[data](/data/): This folder consists of processed data from predictions and Yelp data files
