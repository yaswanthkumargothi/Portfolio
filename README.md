### Machine learning Projects
  1. [Product Demand forecasting and Customer segmentation](/Customerseg/): Thus, it is in Retailer’s interest to forecast the demand of the products based on the trends in past transactions and at the same time obtain customer segments by considering their demographics and past purchases for target marketing.
  2. [Bank Transaction classification](Bank_Transaction_classification.ipynb): Utilizing word embeddings and SVM to classify categories using Bank Transaction descriptors. 
  3. [Bankrupt or Not ](/BankruptorNot/): Predicting given Firm is going to Bankrupt or not using Financial Data. The given data contains financial ratios of various firms and the target attribute tells whether the firm has got bankrupt in the subsequent years or not.

  5. [Heart Disease Classification](HeartDisease.R): A Healthcare organization together with a couple of government hospitals in a city has collected information about the vitals that would reveal if the person might have a coronary heart disease in the next ten years or not. Given the data, we need to develop appropriate models to identify/predict if the person likely to have heart disease or not.
 
 ### Social Media Intelligence
